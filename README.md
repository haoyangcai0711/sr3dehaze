# 10701 Project: Single-image Dehazing using the SR3 Diffusion Model

Our work is based on an unofficial implementation of the SR3 model, which you can view at: https://github.com/Janspiry/Image-Super-Resolution-via-Iterative-Refinement

Original paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07636.pdf

We adapted this SR3 model for the task of image dehazing and trained the model using the RESIDE-beta dataset. For more details, please refer to our report.
